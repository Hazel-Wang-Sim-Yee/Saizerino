It is an e-commerce website that sells k-pop related items. The website also has a points system and karaoke to entice more people to use it.

Essentially, this part is your sales pitch.

Design Process

As a collector/fan of a band, i want to buy as many items from my favourite band so that i can show off my collection.
As a person that likes singing, i want to be able to play music with my friends and sing with them for fun.
As a person that likes to save money, I want to be able to get vouchers and discounts so that i can buy more items with less money.

Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

Existing Features

working user signIn, signUp pages that stores user data - allows users to save their points and other information across different devices as long as using the same account.

search feature - to find the particular item you want in the shop's catalogue

API storage (for products) - allows the list to be easily expanded and updated. 
In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

working points system - for discounts and vouchers to be given to users upon purchasing enough items

working karaoke system - for users to have a shared online room together and sing songs in the catalogue.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

scripts when appended into html files through javascript do not work the same as it is like in the HTML file itself - This caused the website to be unable to save certain information that i want it to save.

password reset verification - the new password and the confirm password can be different and the code will still send a put call to the API eventhough the code has specified that both must be the same to run.
